**_vDevices_**

These simulated devices faithfully replicate the behavior and operations of their physical counterparts, enabling accurate testing and validation of IoT applications and protocols. Leveraging GNS3's scalable architecture, these virtual devices offer a dynamic platform for network engineers, researchers and enthusiasts to experiment and innovate in a controlled environment. The provided virtual ecosystem enables users to explore IoT scenarios, from temperature regulation to surveillance, enabling integrated testing and development in the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things.
