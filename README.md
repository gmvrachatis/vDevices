vThermostat is a device which is designed to simulate the operation of a thermostat. 

It is responsible for both simulation and recognition of the environment. By taking as variables the area of the room it is in and using the sync message to identify the devices in the room, it can simulate the temperature change in a closed air conditioned room. For the temperature change in a room, the function ΔT = Q/(mc) is used which is a fundamental expression of thermodynamics that provides a clear and concise method for quantifying the temperature change (ΔT) in a substance when heat energy (Q) is transferred to or from it. In our case the substance is air where m=ρ*V and the function becomes ΔT= Q/(ρV*c) where Q: thermal energy per second ,ρ: density of air, c: specific heat of air.

**How to Start :**
